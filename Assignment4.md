#### Advantages of Virtual Machines
- VMs are more efficient and contain reduced stranded capacity.
  - VMs are created with the right amount of space for their requirements.
- Multiple servers on one machine affect the performance of one another. Problems in the servers are isolated.
- VMs can be created and destroyed easily, even with programmable APIs to create an destroy VMs at a large scale.
- All activity can be easily moved between physical machines

#### Advantages of Containers
- Containers are groups of processes running on an OS, isolated from other groups of processes. 
- Containers are less wasteful and consume resources at the same level as processes.
- Containers on the same machine do not have dependency or version conflicts.
- They do not require an entire OS, therefore are very lightweight. 
  - The system allocates disk space as needed.


#### Advantages of Physical Machines
- Physical machines have their own CPU, RAM, etc. therefore can run multiple tasks a lot faster.
