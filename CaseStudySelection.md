#### Option #11: Netflix: Best development workflow for a microservice Team.
##### Jennifer Mohr - 2/22/2021

I want to pick the case study for the best development workflow for Netflix's microservice Team because not only am I interested in the architecture of Netflix, but also how a large scale company like Netflix implements their workflow. I've heard a lot about how Netflix uses microservices, and as a regular user of the service it would be insightful to learn more about how it's run. I am interested in cloud computing and company culture, and this case study would allow for the exploration of all of these aspects.
