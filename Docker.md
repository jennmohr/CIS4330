### Docker Partner Assignment
#### Jennifer Mohr & Casey Maloney
To get started, we downloaded Docker Desktop from the Docker hub. After this downloaded, I had to restart my computer and then restart the application. We were presented with a tutorial for using the application.

After running the command given on the command prompt, it pulled the getting-started repository from the hub to the local machine. The image pulled showed up in the Containers/Apps section of Docker.

We then clicked on the button to run the applicaiton in the browser, which launched a window with the pulled HTML code, containing a tutorial on how to use Docker.

After exploring hub.docker.com, we noticed that there was a simple "Hello-World" image that could be pulled and run on our machines. We ran the "docker pull hello-world" command, and the image was cloned onto our machine. After it was pulled, we ran the "docker run hello-world" command, which displayed a message from Docker explaining that the installation worked correctly and gives an explanation on what occured on the application to generate the message.
