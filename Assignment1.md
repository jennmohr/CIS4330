 ### Assignment #1 - Jennifer Mohr

Before reading this article, my only knowledge of microservices came from talking about them in the first week of class. I feel like the article gave me a general understanding of what we will be learning about throughout the course. I found it interesting how many companies that try to attempt to implement microservices into their software development will settle on miniservices instead since they are more independent. Some applications that I use regularly that have microservices implemented include: Netflix, LinkedIn, Twitter, Amazon & Uber. 

Some main points I learned from the article were:
* Advantages of microservices are agility, risk reduction, distributed development, flexibility, scalability & resiliency.
* Risks are possible poor application performance, significantly different architecture, requiring new application infrastructure & disappointing results. 
* Costs are technical changes, cultural changes, agile and DevOps competency, changes in data management, product mindset, team autonomy & complex application infrastructure.
