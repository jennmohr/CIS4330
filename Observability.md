## Observability Services
Observability is activities that allow you to measure, collection and analyze parts of your system. In the case of Microservices Runtime Infrastructure, these services support monitoring, alerting, loggin, tracing and diagnostics. According to the article, microservice observabilty services must support:
- Monitoring the container cluster
- Monitoring services within the cluster
- Visualizing dependencies
- Tracing distributed requests
- Collecting and parsing log data
- Indexing and searchng logs
- Debugging and identifying root causes

Because microservice architecture is different from traditional application building, MSA adopters had to invent and develop their own observability systems. A lot of these systems are available as open-source software as a result. It doesn't seem as if there are big technology companies developing these systems specifically for microservices, but startups and small vendors have been providing commercially supported tools for microservices to use. Other bigger APM vendors have also been extending their current product suites to include microservice capabilities.

My takeaway from the article is that there are a lot of observabilty that has to be available for microservices to be properly maintained, and although the resources were not initally provided to MSA users, the users have adapted to create their own solutions. These users have been generous enough to share their tools as open-source software which makes the adoption of microservices easier.
